/*Javascript: Advanced Functions

This example is a little more advanced.

-	First re-create the .png image using HTML code.
-	Your css will handle highlighting the boxes when the user hovers over them. 

Each box represents a value to be added/subtracted.  
Your JS file should accomplish the following: 
-	The zero box in the center is a running total. It will update with the current total every time the user clicks a box.  
(i.e The box in the middle indicates zero, I click the +30 box and the zero update to 30. I then click the 10 box and it updates t0 40). 

For an extra bonus, use the Red and Blue boxes to update the background color.

Hint: Research the .click(), .text() in jQuery documentation
*/

//Here is some code to get you started:

var total = 0;

$(function(){

	//$(box to be updated).click(function call);


});
