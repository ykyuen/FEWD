Let's have a look at your E-Cardly!



## Homework Review
<aside class="notes"></aside>

** General Feedback & Common Mistakes **

* Good to use `<hr>` as the divider line and assign a proper class on it for different style.
* The Scott Kellum Method should be applied to the html tag containing the text.
* Avoid using `<center>`.
* Selector: `<tag>.<class>:<pseudo class>`
* Use `<ul><li>` for the list items. The `<p>` tag is usually for paragraph with preset `margin`.
* `img` VS `background-image`



## Code Challenge (Identifying nav errors)
<aside class="notes">Both (25 Min)
* The spacing on this element is incorrect: `<div id= " container">`
* The beach image was floated incorrectly
* `ul #navigation li` should be `ul#navigation li`
* `<div id="nav">` needs to be cleared
* id="clear" should be class="clear"
* "lombok-beach.jpg" should be "lombok-beach.jpeg" (sneaky, I know. Note: It doesn't matter which format you use, as long as it is consistent).
* The "lombok-beach.jpeg" image needs a proper alt attribute
